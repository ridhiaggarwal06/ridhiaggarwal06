### 👋 Hi, I'm Ridhi Aggarwal 

**`Bridging the gap between raw data and operational strategy.`**

---

### 📖 The Brand Story
I am a **Business Analytics graduate** with a background in **Operational Analysis**. I don't just look at numbers; I look at the heartbeat of a business. My experience has taught me to track product lifecycles, optimize costs, and find the "why" behind the data to keep things moving forward.

- ⚡ **Fast-Paced:** I specialize in quick-turnaround insights that impact the bottom line.
- 🔍 **Detail-Oriented:** From tracking shipments to cleaning messy datasets, I ensure accuracy.
- 💡 **Strategic:** I use Python, SQL, and Power BI to turn operational hurdles into growth opportunities.
